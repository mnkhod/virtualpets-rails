# Virtual Pets

---
The though behind it is to have web2/web3 mix with dynamic possibilities with virtual pets.

## Features

- Virtual pet nft generation with multiple personalities, catch phrases and animal types
- Backend gives out nft json data henceforth nft's will have dynamic attributes
- You can chat with your virtual pet
- Virtual pet generation also generates an avatar for the pet

## Planned Features

- Allow users to sell their virtual pets
- Level Up with the progress of chatting with the virtual pet
- Achievement system
- Animal shop system for hunger issues
- Mood system allowing gameplay with virtual pets
- Death system so if the virtual pet is dead the nft will be owned by the user but the system wont allow you to interact with the pet

## Tech Choice

- Rails 8, was the perfect choice for quick prototyping
- Allowing background-jobs, good use case for image generation and ai prompt
- Hotwire allowed single page like experience
- Node scripts was used for blockchain interaction with background-jobs
